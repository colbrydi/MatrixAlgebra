    "In numerical linear algebra, we factorize matrices to facilitate efficient and/or accurate computations (they are also helpful in proofs). There are many possible **matrix decompositions**. Some, e.g., the eigendecomposition, require the matrix to be square, while others, e.g., the $QR$ factorization, exist for arbitrary matrices. Among all possible decompositions (also called *factorizations*), some common examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **QR Factorization** from Gram-Schmidt orthogonization: \n",
    "    - $A = QR$\n",
    "    - $Q$ has orthonormal columns and $R$ is a upper-triangular matrix \n",
    "    - If there are zero rows in $R$, we can reduce the number of columns in $Q$\n",
    "    - Exists for arbitrary matrices \n",
    "- **LU / LDU Decomposition** from Gauss Elimination: \n",
    "    - $A = LU$ or $A = LDU$\n",
    "    - $L$ is lower-triangular, $U$ is upper-triangular, and $D$ is diagonal \n",
    "    - Exists for all **square** matrices\n",
    "    - Is *related to Gaussian Elimination*\n",
    "- **Cholesky Decomposition**: \n",
    "    - $A = R^TR\\quad (= LDL^T)$\n",
    "    - $R$ is upper-triangular \n",
    "    - Factorization of $A$ into $R^TR$ requires $A$ be *symmetric* and *positive-definite*. The latter simply requires $x^{T}Ax > 0$ for every $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$. Note that $x^{T}Ax$ is always a scalar value (e.g., note that $x^TA = y^T$ for some vector $y\\in\\mathbb{R}^n$, and $y^Tx$ is the dot product between $x$ and $y$ and, hence, a real scalar).\n",
    "- **Schur Decomposition**:   \n",
    "    - $A = UTU^{T}$\n",
    "    - $U$ is orthogonal and $T$ is upper-triangular \n",
    "    - Exists for every square matrix and says every such matrix, $A$, is unitarily equivalent to an upper-triangular matrix, $T$ (i.e., there exists an orthonomal basis with respect to which $A$ is upper-triangular)\n",
    "    - Eigenvalues on diagonal of $T$\n",
    "- **Singular Value Decomposition**: \n",
    "    - $A = U\\Sigma V^{T}$\n",
    "    - $U$ is orthogonal, $V$ is orthogonal, and $\\Sigma$ is diagonal \n",
    "    - Exists for arbitrary matrices\n",
    "- **Eigenvalue Decomposition**: \n",
    "    - $A = X\\Lambda X^{-1}$\n",
    "    - $X$ is invertible and $\\Lambda$ is diagonal \n",
