    "\n",
    "During class today we will write an iterative method (named after Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi) to solve the following system of equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ 6x + 2y - ~z = 4~$$\n",
    "$$~ x + 5y + ~z = 3~$$\n",
    "$$ 2x +~ y + 4z = 27$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a basic outline of the Jacobi method algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize each of the variables as zero ($x_0 = 0, y_0 = 0, z_0 = 0$) \n",
    "2. Calculate the next iteration using the above equations and the values from the previous iterations. For example here is the formula for calculating $x_i$ from $y_{(i-1)}$ and $z_{(i-1)}$ based on the first equation:\n",
    "    $$x_i = \\frac{4 - 2y_{(i-1)} + z_{(i-1)}}{6} $$\n",
    "    Similarly, we can obtain the update for $y_i$ and $z_i$ from the second and third equations, respectively.\n",
    "3. Increment the iteration counter $(i = i + 1)$ and repeat Step 2.\n",
    "4. Stop when the answer \"converges\" or a maximum number of iterations has been reached. (ex. $i$ = 100)\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT NOTE:** \n",
    "\n",
    "> A sufficient (but not necessary) condition for the method to converge is that the matrix A is strictly or irreducibly [diagonally dominant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagonally_dominant_matrix). Strict row diagonal dominance means that for each row, the absolute value of the diagonal term is greater than the sum of absolute values of other terms. - From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobi_method)\n",
